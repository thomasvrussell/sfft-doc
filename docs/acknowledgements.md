The version ``sfft v1.6`` is developed during the [NASA GPU Hackathon 2024] as part of the pipeline optimization efforts for the [Roman Supernova PIT team]. The valuable support and insightful suggestions from our team members and Hackathon mentors are essential for the improvements in this version of SFFT. 

I would like to specifically acknowledge the contributions of the following team members: Lauren Aldoroty (Duke), Robert Knop (LBNL), Shu Liu (Pitt), and Michael Wood-Vasey (Pitt). Additionally, I am grateful for the guidance provided by our mentors, Marcus Manos and Lucas Erlandson from NVIDIA.
