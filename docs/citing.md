  [^1]:
    The first publication of SFFT introduced the fundamental methodology behind the SFFT approach.

  [^2]:
    The second publication of SFFT introduced several adaptations and improvements. We incorporated kernel regularization into SFFT and extended the method to be fully compatible with ZOGY's statistically closed-form framework. This hybrid approach preserves the general workflow of ZOGY while adding image-matching refinements using the SFFT code, making it an optimal subtraction engine for space telescopes such as JWST/NIRCam and Roman.
